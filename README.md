# BwFootballClub

BW Football Club is a web app that offers visitors the best experience in football news and live scores
It was built with [Angular](https://angular.io) version 7.0.3.

## Duration

Preliminary works i.e. planning and research, started on the eve of Sunday 13th, September 2019. The project started fully on Tuesday, 15th September 2019 and was completed Today 18th, September 2019.

## Challenge

Deciding which state management method to use was a tough call to make. After some research I decided to use Rxjs. It is an in built module in Anugular. 
Implementing Rxjs did come with its some challenegs but I prevailed.

## Fun

I enjoyed working with SCSS CSS preprocessor it made writing CSS Great Again.
Special attention was giving to the responsivness of the site.

## Libraries and Frameworks 

Bootstrap CSS framework was used to ensure responsiveness across screens.
Moment.js came to the rescue with it's date formating powers.

Although not a Library or a Framework, [Football Data](https://www.football-data.org) was SUPER helpful in building the site.
All data was provided through Football Data's public api.
